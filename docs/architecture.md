# Nextronous Core Architecture

Nextronous Core is built using a modular architecture that separates the platform into logical components. This architecture provides a robust and scalable infrastructure for building financial applications.

## Components

* **API**: The API is the entry point for the platform and provides a RESTful interface for interacting with the platform.
* **Database**: The database stores all data for the platform and provides a scalable and secure storage solution.
* **Cache**: The cache provides a high-performance caching solution for frequently accessed data.
* **Logger**: The logger provides a centralized logging solution for the platform.

## Data Flow

The data flow for the platform is as follows:

1. The API receives a request from a client.
2. The API processes the request and retrieves data from the database.
3. The API caches frequently accessed data in the cache.
4. The API logs all requests and responses in the logger.

## Security

The platform provides advanced security features to ensure secure data storage and transmission. These features include:

* **Encryption**: All data is encrypted using AES-256 encryption.
* **Authentication**: All requests are authenticated using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
* **Authorization**: All requests are authorized using role-based access control (RBAC).

## Scalability

The platform is designed to be scalable and provides a number of features to support high-performance and reliability. These features include:

* **Load Balancing**: The platform uses load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple instances.
* **Auto Scaling**: The platform uses auto scaling to dynamically adjust the number of instances based on traffic.
* **Caching**: The platform uses caching to reduce the load on the database and improve performance.
